My name is Jade Rubick. I build engineering organizations that allow people to do their best work. You can read more about that by clicking on that LinkedIn link below. 

This blog's code is based on work by Atte Juvonen and others. The code is on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/jadeforrest/blog/). Feel free to submit corrections or use the code to create your own blog (but do not host my content elsewhere).
